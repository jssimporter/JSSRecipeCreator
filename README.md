Huge thanks to Shea Craig, who wrote the bulk of this work and is still providing advice, though not currently involved in Jamf administration.

The world of Mac administration evolves fast, and continued functionality of JSSRecipeCreator and python-jss requires active engagement from the Jamf-using Mac Admin community. If you think you can help and have ideas, please go ahead and file issues and pull requests, or contact us in the MacAdmins Slack `#jss-importer` channel.
